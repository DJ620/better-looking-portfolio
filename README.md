# DJ Hersh's Web-Development Portfolio

## Description

Hello, I am DJ Hersh, and this is the repository for my web-development portfolio. It is a website to showcase the work I have done. I wanted a clean and pleasing design, and my good friend John Walbolt helped me with the initial format. I used Bootstrap for the layout to make it responsive for all screen sizes. I utilized box-shadow and text-shadow quite a bit so I could get the affect of the page being 3D.
